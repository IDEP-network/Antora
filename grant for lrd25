Hello!
My name is Ruslan Latypov, my nickname is lrd25. 
I am 24 years old and I have been fond of cryptocurrency, blockchain technology and everything related to it for 2 years now. 
Since I have a technical mindset, I am very interested in supporting nodes and testnets. 
Back in 2021 I learned about IDEP project, I liked the idea of the project and applied for a paid testnet "Sanford". 
After a while I found out that I was chosen among the lucky ones and was given the role of Sanford in discord and I was very happy about it. 
I participated in all phases of the testnet, delved more deeply into the Cosmos blockchain, and kept my validator running smoothly. 
I would love to get a grant on the main network to continue this journey with IDEP. 
I won't let you down and will hope to get one, thank you! Have a good day!
