Hello Team,
My name is Sergii. I work independently and in cooperation with other teams when it's necessary. I have 18+ years of IT experience and participated in multiple projects.
At the moment I'm a mainnet validator and ambassador in Oasis, Solana, Sifchain, Cere Network, Mises mainnets and and dozen different testnets.

Link to projects with my id can be found on https://sergo.top

I believe I can help your project as experienced validator and tech support. I like automatization and create scripts to make routine tasks faster and get predictable results.
