I am very interested in running a validator on IDEP Network. I have one years experience running validators in Cosmos Ecosystem.
Currently I am a network validator IDEP 2.0/ChainFlip/Kira Network and also tested Massa/Apros/SSV/Celestia/Anoma/IronFish/Evmos/Pontem/UMEE.
This is my telegram channel https://t.me/lama_pama where you can get more information about me.
		
Gimme gold!
