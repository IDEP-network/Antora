Hello my name is Alex Turetskiy!

Idep wallet:   `idep1hsqtg5jcpg6ed5kcu8v4u7ync0hhlv8klk6ke7`

I am very pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the selection for a mainnet validator on IDEP Network. Thank you!

### About my experience
I have been testing and validating since 2019. My first projects: NuCypher, Mina Protocol, The Graph, Althea, Agoric.  
My main positive trait is that **I love my job and am constantly learning new topics** such as security, automation, monitoring, logging, etc.

### Networks I validate
I am a mainnet validator for:
- [Gravity Bridge](https://www.mintscan.io/gravity-bridge/validators/gravityvaloper1rqhsh8smda90d3n7txty38n44z5qfqpenp3q2v)
- [IRIS Network](https://www.mintscan.io/iris/validators/iva19ul0uva3fgtm6cd6tceprre4ghsfh6h3u29lcg)

- [Quicksilver](https://quicksilver.explorers.guru/validator/quickvaloper1qr688u3h9v6xenm7uwn8sp79yh7tgu76cqn2tv)
### How could I be helpful for IDEP
[[Here](https://github.com/AlexToTheSun/Validator_Activity/tree/main/Mainnet-Guides/IDEP)]  is the github link in which I present to the IDEP community guides. I hope this helps someone improve the reliability of the validator, and hence the IDEP network. Topicks:
- Sentry Node Architecture for IDEP
- Tmkms for IDEP (double-signing protection)
- Minimal server protection for servers
- I have Run a [public RPC node](https://github.com/AlexToTheSun/Validator_Activity/blob/main/State-Sync/IDEP.md) for State Sync in `Antora` chain.


Please look at my [github](https://github.com/AlexToTheSun/Validator_Activity) to see more about my activity and contribution to the cosmos ecosystem.
Best Regards, Aleksandr.
