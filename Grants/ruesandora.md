# Why do I want to be a validator in IDEP?

I want it as a community rather than a person, if you look at my twitter account, my website and my other accounts, you will see that we are a large community. we have a lot of developer investor research people in our community so we care about community validators
I will never have any expectations, I have been the leader of IDEP Community for a while and I manage the Turkish telegram group and I talk to people about IDEP in my live broadcasts.

# Thanks, Rues
