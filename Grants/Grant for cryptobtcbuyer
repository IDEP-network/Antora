Greetings to the IDEP team!
I am Independent PoS Validator, my moniker "cryptobtcbuyer"

IDEP wallet address: idep167jmxsvlspfwm6r87epkfrw2ww6n5mnaqv74f7

I am an early supporter of your project, took part in testnets:
DENALI — idepvaloper1r9utfjcc7jq5lgvm54hgr6l4ahmjuzkssghq9c
SANFORD  — idepvaloper1y7nzhgl4k5de4tqx820axllzlq2qdsqdpvsk75
SANFORD 2 — idepvaloper167jmxsvlspfwm6r87epkfrw2ww6n5mnax352km

During the testnets, I maintained a high node uptime and completed all tasks.
For example, my nft collection, created as part of the SANFORD testnet, was retweeted by the Idep account:

In projects in which I take part:
— I maintain a high uptime of the node, 
— I keep test networks to check for updates before transferring them to the main network,
— I help less experienced validators in discord and telegram chats, 
— I supplement and edit the documentation.
— 24/7 monitoring with telegram alerts is installed on my nodes.
