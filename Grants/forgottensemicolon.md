# Why do I want to be a validator in IDEP?
As someone in the technology and software world for a long time, I want to be a part of this technology being in a better place because of the innovations that come with idep. 
Also, as someone who closely follows the cosmos ecosystem, idep network has been one of my favorites among many projects.It was the project with the most beautiful documentation in the cosmos ecosystem.
