Hello Team! My actual IDEP wallet address (i used from first testnet) is: idep10y06f2zj0nlfyymdjv8yd9f7gyj73fqljrfz03
The reason for submitting my grant application is simple - I participated in IDEP's closed testnet from the very first phase (nodename: jwsg21), I was in the top 30 on the validator table. The testnet was very long, but I decided that it makes no sense to stop now, it is necessary to bring the matter to the end, since I frankly still hope for some kind of rewards from the team. Therefore, I am asking for a grant so that I can continue to be a validator. Best regards.
