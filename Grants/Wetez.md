Why Wetez
===
Wetez has always taken a keen interest in the development of the Cosmos ecosystem and the progress of IDEP is impressive. We are following the development of IDEP since its testnet. As we are providing stable verification services for numerous projects of the Cosmos ecosystem, we believe that Wetez is also capable of running validator nodes for the IDEP mainnet and building the IDEP ecosystem together with other developers.
